/**
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — `MED_BALL_CHEST_PASS_PARTNER_VARIANT_UNPRESCRIBABLE`
 *
 * The canonical documentation (see source above, "Exercise Identity" —
 * "Equipment: Medicine Ball, Wall or Partner") supports two independent
 * setups: throwing against a wall, or throwing to/from a partner. This is
 * a CAS Engine decision, not a VITA one — the Exercise Requirements Model
 * below is deliberately built to match that full documented reality
 * (`usable_wall` OR `partner`), not the narrower scope already integrated
 * one layer downstream: `prescription/exercisePrescriptionRegistry.ts`
 * currently integrates `med_ball_chest_pass` as "WALL VARIANT ONLY" —
 * `medicine_ball` AND `wall` required together, with no partner-based path
 * (see `__tests__/prescription/ballisticExercises.test.ts`,
 * "med_ball_chest_pass requires both medicine_ball and wall — neither
 * alone suffices").
 *
 * Consequence: an athlete/environment combination that satisfies this
 * exercise's `requirements` solely through the `partner` branch (medicine
 * ball + throwing allowed + sufficient space + partner available, but no
 * usable wall) will pass `checkExerciseEligibility` here, then fail at
 * `getExercisePrescriptionSource`/`prescribeExercise` for lack of the
 * `wall` equipment capability the registry still requires today.
 *
 * This is a deliberate, explicit, documented gap — not a silent one:
 * eligibility must reflect the exercise's full documented reality, and the
 * CAS Engine must never let the prescription layer's current integration
 * scope quietly narrow what the selection layer considers possible.
 * Closing this gap (e.g. adding a partner-only prescription variant, or
 * surfacing an explicit "eligible, unprescribable" outcome in the engine
 * run result / Decision Trace) is out of scope for this wiring step and
 * does not change the prescription contract here.

/**
 * Unlike every other ballistic exercise integrated so far, this exercise's
 * canonical documentation names exactly one setup — "Exercise Identity" —
 * "Equipment: Medicine Ball, Open Space" — with no wall or partner
 * alternative documented anywhere in the chapter. No `any_of` clause is
 * therefore needed, and no `MED_BALL_REVERSE_THROW_..._UNPRESCRIBABLE`
 * known-limitation constant is required: `exercisePrescriptionRegistry.ts`
 * already integrates the exact same equipment pair
 * (`requiredEquipmentCapabilities: ["medicine_ball", "open_space"]`), so
 * there is no wall/partner branch our eligibility layer permits that the
 * prescription layer cannot serve. The backward throw direction itself is
 * represented entirely through existing biomechanical fields
 * (`forceVectors: ["upward", "backward"]`) — no ad hoc "reverse" or
 * "backward-projection" capability is introduced in the Exercise
 * Requirements Model.
